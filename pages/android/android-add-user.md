## Overview
You can add a user for a company to let him view that company's data by giving him full *Admin* access or *Partial* access of data by assigning permissions.  

## Data Access Levels
### 1. Admin  
  A user with *Admin* access can:
  + View all the data and reports.
  + Add another user to the company.
  + Delete other users from the company.
  + Delete himself from the company.
  + Delete you from the company.  

*Note: If you want a user to view all the data but not Add / Delete a user to the company then turn off **Admin** permission and turn on all other permissions manually.*  

### 2. Permission by Ledger Group  
  The user can only view data of the assigned *Ledger group*.  
  *Note: User will also be able to see data of any other permission given.*

### 3. Permission by Inventory Stock  
  The user can only view data of the assigned *Inventory stock*.  
  *Note: User will also be able to see data of any other permission given.*

### 4. Expense Report  
  You can give access to *Expense Report* to a user by this permission.

5. If the user is already using **Biz Analyst** they will get a notification on their phone and an email notifying them that they have been added to the company and you will see their name and email address in the list of users you have added. If the user is not using the app, they will get an email with instructions to complete the invite process. You will still see their name in users list with an indication saying *Invitation Pending*. This will go away once the user follows the instructions sent on their email.
